Debian machine configured with supervisor and chef as a base for other machines build with chef-solo.

Credits go to http://tech.paulcz.net/2013/09/creating-immutable-servers-with-chef-and-docker-dot-io.html and to https://github.com/maxexcloo/Docker for the original debian/supervisor docker image and for the idea of running chef-solo as a mean to simply build docker images.
